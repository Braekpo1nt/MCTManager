# Dependencies
Dependencies that are require to run this plugin

## Data Packs
As of release `v0.3.0-alpha`, this plugin expects the following data packs in the server's `world/datapacks/` directory:
- [mctdatapack](https://github.com/Braekpo1nt/mctdatapack)

## Plugins
Required plugins. Read this or you will get errors. 

- This plugin depends on [Multiverse-Core v4.3.1](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/releases/tag/v4.3.1)
- This plugin softdepends on [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/) or any permissions manager (only tested with LuckPerms)
  - You will need to give all players the `mv.bypass.gamemode.*`, as this is the only way to avoid Multiverse-Core forcing gamemodes on your players during your games. 
    - If you don't give this permission to all participants, they will be able to respawn by disconnecting and reconnecting, and will often be in the wrong game mode when travelling worlds. 

# Commands

See the [commands reference](./docs/commands.md) for all commands and what they do.

# Running the event

### Starting a game
You can start a game with the following command:

- [/mct game start <game>](./docs/commands.md#mct-game)

You can also start a game with a [vote](#voting)

### Stopping a game
If a game is running, you can manually stop a game with the following command:

- [/mct game stop [true|false]](./docs/commands.md#mct-game)

### Voting

You can initiate a vote for all online participants. You must specify the games you want to be voted for (must be at least one):

- [/mct game vote [one or more games]](./docs/commands.md#mct-game)

### Adding a new team
Every participant must be on a team, so you must first have at least one team. To add a new team, use the [/mct team](./docs/commands.md#mct-team) command.

### Removing a team
You can remove a team entirely using the [/mct team](./docs/commands.md#mct-team) command. Points are lost and team members are removed, also losing their points, as if you [removed them manually](#removing-a-participant)


## Participants
In order to host an event, you need to [add participants](#adding-a-new-participant) (the plugin has to know who is a participant and who is an admin).

### Adding a new participant
Participants must be on a team, so you must first [add a new team](#adding-a-new-team)

To add a new participant, use the [/mct team](./docs/commands.md#mct-team) command.

If you add a new participant while a game is going on, they will be sent to that game as a participant. 

### Removing a participant
The only way to remove a participant is to leave them from their team using the [/mct team](./docs/commands.md#mct-team) command.

### Listing teams and scores

You can list the teams, their participants, and their scores with the [/mct team](./docs/commands.md#mct-team) command.

### Modifying scores

You can add, subtract, or set the scores of players and teams with the [/mct team](./docs/commands.md#mct-team) command.

# Config files (Configuration files)

Many games and other attributes can be configured using config files. See [this tutorial on config files](./docs/configuration.md) to learn how to modify them to your needs and desires.

## **Important note about building the project:**

### Gradle Wrapper
This project includes a [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html). If you don't know what that means, all you need to know is that instead of running `gradle build`, you should run `./gradlew build`. You should also configure your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) to [use the project's gradle wrapper](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/guide/tutorials/working-with-gradle/gradle-wrapper/). 

A gradle wrapper essentially just makes it so that everyone who is developing on the project is using the same exact version of Gradle. 

### Shadow Jar
The dependency `fr.mrmicky:fastboard:1.2.1` from [FastBoard](https://github.com/MrMicky-FR/FastBoard) needs to be included in the jar file with *Shadow Jar*. 

To do this, simply run `./gradlew shadowJar` instead of `./gradle build`. Otherwise, you'll get an error like the following when you try to add the plugin to your project:
